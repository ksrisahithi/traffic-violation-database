As there exists people that use various vehicles to commute in the city and also commute intercity, there can be instances where people donâ€™t clearly follow the regulations that are set for when you are driving a vehicle or riding a motorbike. A necessity arises to record all those people that have committed such violations and have them recorded onto a reliable data storage system. It is not quite possible to maintain the records of all those that have violated the traffic discipline in written form and maintain them as the folders. Here is where one can make use of the computerized application that provides such an environment to people such as them who work and are associated with the traffic control and violations department. This brings in the conveniences on the table and makes the recording of the details of the drivers and riders who commit such violations easy.
The reason for the implementation of this project is to provide such an environment to the people that manage those violations that are committed by the general public. While a person that is associated with the traffic police department and such organization can record these violations, in another instance a person from the general public that wishes to view their details and to know whether they are booked for any such violations can also interact with the application.

## Objective

To provide an environment to a person that associates themselves with the traffic police department and such organization where they can access the details of the vehicles and the public that owns them.

To either book them if they have committed any violations or view their past sheets.

To also provide an environment to the general public to view if they are either booked in any of the violations. And to also notify them to pay the fine if in the case that they are booked in any of the violations.

To be able to provide the details of the acts that are prohibited while in the traffic and give a detailed description on it.

To keep it minimalistic and easy to use while also not letting the application dissociate because of the masses of the data that it deals with.

To replace the traditional file recording system that were mostly handwritten to completely computerized system.

To track the arrears of the general public booked for the violations.
